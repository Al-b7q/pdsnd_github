### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project explores US bikeshare data using Python and Pandas. 
It aims to analyze bikeshare usage patterns across different cities in the United States, including Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C.


### Files used
1. `bikeshare.py`: Python script for analyzing bikeshare data.
2. `chicago.csv`: Contains bikeshare data for the city of Chicago.
3. `new_york_city.csv`: Contains bikeshare data for the city of New York City.
4. `washington.csv`: Contains bikeshare data for the city of Washington, D.C.

The `bikeshare.py` script utilizes the bikeshare data stored in the CSV files (`chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, and `washington.csv`) to perform analysis and generate insights about bikeshare usage patterns across different cities in the United States.

### Credits
This project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The bikeshare data used in this project was provided by Udacity.

Special thanks to the instructors and mentors at Udacity for their guidance and support throughout the project.

Additionally, the Pandas library, a fundamental component of this project for data manipulation and analysis, was developed by the open-source community. We acknowledge the contributions of all those who have contributed to the development of Pandas.
